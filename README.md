# Peeves

A small layer on the built in unit testing and documentation building frameworks.
Provides little utilities to support testing, like a timer and profiler.
No assurances of reliability, but also not too bad to read the source.

## Installation

We're distributing this via GitHub, so just `git clone` it where you need to
